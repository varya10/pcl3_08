## Language Quiz
This is a language identifier implemented in eight languages. It is based on n-gram language identification and inspired by “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”. Simple as it is, type some text and see if the app can guess what language it is. You can choose between bi-grams, tri-grams, quad-grams and some of n-grams and compare the results. But if you don’t trust our home-made identifier, a well-known language identifier “Langid” is also at your disposal.
Implemented in python.
Corpus: downloaded from Tatoeba corpus.
