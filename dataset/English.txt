lovely place to be if you are here to earn money im so fat so what im gonna shoot him im not a real fish im just a mere plushy im just saying that was probably what influenced their decision ive always wondered what itd be like to have siblings this is what i would have said it would take forever for me to explain everything thats because youre a girl sometimes i cant help showing emotions its a word id like to find a substitute for it would be something id have to program i dont intend to be selfish lets consider the worst that could happen how many close friends do you have i may be antisocial but it doesnt mean i dont talk to people this is always the way it has been i think it is best not to be impolite one can always find time id be unhappy but i wouldnt kill myself back in high school i got up at 6 am every morning when i woke up i was sad that is somewhat explained at the end i thought you liked to learn new things most people write about their daily life if i could send you a marshmallow trang i would in order to do that you have to take risks every person who is alone is alone because they are afraid of others why do you ask i am not an artist i never had the knack for it i cant tell her now its not that simple anymore i am a flawed person but these are flaws that can easily be fixed whenever i find something i like its too expensive how long did you stay maybe it will be exactly the same for him innocence is a beautiful thing humans were never meant to live forever i dont want to lose my ideas even though some of them are a bit extreme i think i have a theory about that that is intriguing you are saying you intentionally hide your good looks i do not have an account in these forums if anyone was to ask what the point of the story is i really dont know i didnt know where it came from i think my living with you has influenced your way of living this is not important i didnt like it shes asking how thats possible youre just running away from lifes problems if you look at the lyrics they dont really mean much theres a problem there that you dont see you can do it my physics teacher doesnt care if i skip classes i wish i could go to japan i hate it when there are a lot of people i have to go to bed after that i left but then i realized that i forgot my backpack at their house i wont ask you anything else today it may freeze next week even though he apologized im still furious the police will get you to find the bullets thanks for having explained to me at last why people take me for an idiot that wasnt my intention thanks for your explanation theoretically im doing math if you didnt know me that way then you simply didnt know me it almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day i dont know what you mean my computer has got to be useful for something you wanted to tell me about freedom uh now its really weird if i wanted to scare you i would tell you what i dreamt about a few weeks ago one cant expect everything from schools there are many words that i dont understand i dont like it when mathematicians who know much more than i do cant express themselves explicitly youre really not stupid i need to ask you a silly question i dont know how to demonstrate it since its too obvious i wouldnt have thought i would someday look up viagra in wikipedia can it be phrased in another way no one will know i found a solution but i found it so fast that it cant be the right solution it seems interesting to me except that here its not so simple i like candlelight what did you answer no hes not my new boyfriend its too bad that i dont need to lose weight you never have class or what i will play sudoku then instead of continuing to bother you where is the problem i can only wait its not much of a surprise is it i love you i dont like you anymore i am curious congratulations i dont want to wait that long why dont you come visit us but the possibility seems unlikely i shouldnt have logged off i dont know what to do anymore it is inevitable that i go to france someday i just dont know when i hate chemistry i didnt want this to happen you can probably guess what happens though next thing you know youll be in the papers what other options do i have i am not much of a traveller i have nothing better to do i cant explain it either everyone has strengths and weaknesses seriously though episode 21 made me almost cry while laughing it only shows youre not a robot how could i be a robot robots dont dream its not something anyone can do i dont know if i still have it what do you think ive been doing dont underestimate my power my mom doesnt speak english very well i dont speak french well enough i was wondering if you were going to show up today therein lies the problem how do you find food in outer space all you can do is trust one another everyone wants to meet you youre famous why are you sorry for something you havent done i utterly despise formal writing foreign people intrigue me whatever i do she says i can do better what keeps you up so late youd be surprised what you can learn in a week i dont have anyone whod travel with me youre not fast enough life is hard but i am harder bearing can be unbearable stop it youre making her feel uncomfortable nothing is beautiful but the truth tomorrow he will land on the moon i dont speak japanese this is a pun nobody understands me i learned to live without her its useless to keep on thinking any more i have too many things on my mind these days i just wanted to check my email do you really need to ask the question to know the answer you cant expect me to always think of everything i suppose that behind each thing we have to do theres something we want to do you really dont have the right priorities dont expect others to think for you you never have time for important things its no use pretending to make me believe that i believe things you dont believe it would take me too much time to explain to you why its not going to work im so dumb im trying to explain things to you that i dont understand myself stop seeing me as a normal person are you referring to me there will always be things i will never learn i dont have eternity before me it cant be i wish i could care more about my grades but it seems that at a certain point of my life i decided they wouldnt be so important anymore a rolling stone gathers no moss is a proverb would you like something to drink
